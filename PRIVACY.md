Privacy Policy for Legal Clause Identifier Dify Plugin
Effective Date: June 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Legal Clause Identifier" Dify Plugin (the "Plugin") processes information when you use it within your Dify applications (Chatflows, Workflows, or Agents).

1. Introduction
The Legal Clause Identifier Dify Plugin is designed to analyze text and identify common legal clauses by integrating with the Thomson Reuters API. This Plugin operates as a bridge, forwarding your text analysis requests to the Thomson Reuters API and presenting the retrieved information back to you within Dify.

2. Information We Process
When you use the Plugin, the following information is involved:

Input Data: The primary input processed by the Plugin is the text you provide for legal analysis, and optionally, specific keywords for targeted searches.

API Keys/Endpoints: Your Thomson Reuters API Key and Endpoint URL are securely stored within your Dify environment's plugin credentials. The Plugin accesses these credentials only to authenticate and direct its requests to the Thomson Reuters API.

3. How Information is Used
The text and keywords you provide are used solely for the purpose of constructing a query to the Thomson Reuters API to perform legal clause identification. The retrieved analysis and identified clauses are then returned to your Dify application.

The Plugin itself does not store, log, or retain any of the text inputs, keywords, or the analysis retrieved from the Thomson Reuters API beyond the immediate processing of your request.

4. Information Sharing and Disclosure
To fulfill your request, the text and keywords you provide will be transmitted to the Thomson Reuters API (a third-party service). By using this Plugin, you acknowledge and agree that your text input and search parameters will be shared with Thomson Reuters for the purpose of executing the legal analysis.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Thomson Reuters. We encourage you to review Thomson Reuters' own privacy policy to understand how they collect, use, and share your information.

5. Data Retention
As stated above, the Plugin does not retain any of your input data or retrieved legal analysis. The processing is real-time and ephemeral. Information retention, if any, for your queries would be governed by Thomson Reuters' data retention policies and Dify's platform policies.

6. Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the Plugin itself from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. While the Plugin handles your API key securely via Dify's credential management, you are responsible for keeping your Dify credentials and Thomson Reuters API key confidential.

7. Your Rights
Since the Plugin does not store your data, direct access, correction, or deletion requests regarding data processed by the Plugin should be directed to the Dify platform (for your interaction history) or to Thomson Reuters (for any data they might retain related to API calls made from your account).

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Plugin's listing or associated documentation within the Dify platform. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

9. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the Plugin's data practices, please contact the Plugin developer (pragnyan ramtha) through the Dify platform's support channels.
